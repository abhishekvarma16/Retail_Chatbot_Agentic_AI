# Retail_Chatbot_Agentic_AI

The purpose of this project was to help retail store managers gain insights into product quality issues, return policies, and efficiency. Retailers receive thousands of product complaints, return requests, and service queries every day, making it extremely difficult to track all these issues and take corrective actions. Analyzing each review manually is time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, support data, return policy rules, and product metadata often reside in disconnected systems, further complicating the process for retail managers to manage the data and extract relevant information.

Solution:
To solve all these issues, we implemented a solution: introducing a smart, agentic AI chatbot designed to transform retail customer support. This chatbot understands natural language and intelligently routes requests to specific tools. There are three primary tools in our system:

Summarize product complaints
Analyze support resolution efficiency
Retrieve accurate return/refund policies
Each tool has its own purpose and works in sync with the data available in the system.
